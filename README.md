## Hi there ğŸ‘‹
ğŸ˜„ I am krishna! Currently pursuing masters.âœ¨
ğŸŒ±I have around 2.8 yrs of Experience in .NET full stack web development as Senior Full Stack Engineering Analyst.
   Here I am, now as a student craving for all the knowledge i could learn.
ğŸ“«I am greatly interested in how non human things or machines in the sense are trying to mimic humans at a certain accuracy.
   Machine Learning and Web Development are my interests and my passion.
